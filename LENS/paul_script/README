o   This directory contains two meshes "a2.rea" and "a3.rea"

o   "a3.rea" was built from "a2.rea" using the script described below.


o   Here, we are generating a mesh with very few elements.

o   I recommend to run with as few elements as possible and to use
    higher polynomial order.

    We could, however, increase the number of elements with a more 
    complex mesh... Let me know if you want to go this route.


--------------------------------------------------------------------

The script "scale_mesh"  will take a2.rea and extend it to a 

   [-.7,.7]^2 

box.

You can change the ".7" value and generate a new script.   Example
of script is here:

pretex << EOF
a33
   1 READ PREVIOUS PARAMETERS 
a2
   1 BUILD FROM FILE          
a2
   3 GLOBAL REFINE            
  11 STRETCH                  
   5 Stretch R                
0.5  Input protected radius:
-.7 0.7  Input new xmin/xmax (0,0 to scale):  -6.000000E-01  6.000000E-01
-.7 0.7  Input new ymin/ymax (0,0 to scale):  -6.000001E-01  6.000000E-01
   1 UP MENU                  
   1 END GLOBAL REFINE        
   4 CURVE SIDES              
   8 Convert Midside to Circle
500  Input maxium radius:
   1 BUILD MENU               
   1 END    ELEMENTS          
   1 ACCEPT MATL,QVOL         
   1 ACCEPT B.C.'s            
   1 ACCEPT B.C.'s            
   1 EXIT                     
EOF


Thus, you'll have two Gap cases

        G = 1.2-1.0 = 0.2   (a2.rea)
        G = 1.4-1.0 = 0.4   (a3.rea)


With these, using the .usr file that rescales in usrdat2() you
can cover every case that has G/D = 0.2  and G/D=0.4  from these
two files.
