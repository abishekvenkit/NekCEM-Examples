In matlab:

>> quick_lens

will produce 

   rea.nel       Number of elements
   rea.xy        X-Y data
   rea.cs        Curve side data
   rea.xyc       centers of circles (for flat lens)


Then, the unix script

mkq

will first build qq.rea, then it will assign boundary conditions
in a new mesh

qqc.rea



If you want more rings of disks, edit quick_lens.m and change
the first loop index.  For example,

for k=1:9;

will generate 9 rings.
